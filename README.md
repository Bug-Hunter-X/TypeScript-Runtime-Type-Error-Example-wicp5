This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in TypeScript: while TypeScript's type system catches many errors at compile time, it doesn't prevent all runtime errors.  The example showcases a scenario where type mismatches, although flagged by the compiler, can lead to unexpected runtime behavior if not properly addressed. The solution shows how to mitigate the risks using runtime type checking.
